# Blow Transfer 

 This project is to implement Blowfish algorithm through a website where users can share their files securely. 

 File sharing system provides a platform that enables a tremendous number of nodes to share their files.  

 Retrieving desired files efficiently and trustworthily is critical in such a large and jumbled system.

 However, the issues of secure and trustworthy transferring files have been studied separately.
 
 
# About      
 Online File Sharing is practice of sharing files among different users across the internet.

 Common forms of file sharing are FTP (File Transfer Protocol) model and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) file sharing network. 
 
 Another common form of sharing files over the internet is for a user to upload files to a website and allow other users to download them from the website. 

 Users of an online file sharing website who use features like upload, download, share, search etc. would want a website that is very interactive, fast, and secure and not annoying with a lot of post backs and flashing screens. The normal web based file folder view would be good, but if there are other types of visualizations it would be great. Another important issue to consider is the location where the website stores the uploaded files. 
 
 Two places where one can store the uploaded files are Database and Server.

 In our application the file are stored on the server and file will be transferred in encrypted form which doubles the security of the system.
